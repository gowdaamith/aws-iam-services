 AWS IAM  Security and access analyxer dashboard

Create  a Project  that automatically monitors IAM resources, analyxes accesss, reports unused permission and enforces organizational policies  using AWS services .terraform  and optionally some scripting for automation

Some of the important concepts  to know before doing this projext are

1.Access reports 
___________________

what is it:>

*These are reports generated by IAM  Access Analyzzer that show which of your resources  are accessible outside your accout

*They specially analyze resource-based policies

what it looks At:>

*Access Analyzer only checks resources that supports resource-based policies such as:
*A s3 bucket (bucket policies,acl)
*KMS keys (key policiese)
*IAM roles (trust policies that allow external principal to assume them)
*Lambda funtions and layer (funtion policies)
*SQS Queue
*SNS topics
*Secreat manager secrets (resource policies)

why its important:>
*prevents unintended data leaks
*helps you meet compliance  requirement 

2.Resource analysis:>
______________________
what is it:>

**A feature of IAM Access Ananlyxer  that lets you analyze a single resource to understand
  1.Who has access to it
  2.what type of access they have
  3.whether that access is from inside your account or external 

its like doing an X -ray scan of one resources's permission

where its used 
*S3 buckets --> check if a bucket  is public or shared  with another account
*KMS keys -->ensures only authorized iam roles  ro services have encrypt or                   decrypt rights
*IAM roles -->verify that no external  account or untrusted  services can assume               the role
*SNS topics /sqs ->queue confirm only expected  publisher  and subscriber can us                  e them
*Secrets manager secrets --> check if secrets are exposed across accounts

why its important:>
*Why important

 Prevent Security Incidents â†’ Stops accidental exposure (e.g., public S3 bucket leaks).

* Enforce Least Privilege â†’ Ensures only required entities have access.

* Compliance â†’ Demonstrates strong access control for audits (PCI-DSS, GDPR, HIPAA).

* Proactive Security â†’ Lets you catch issues before a misconfigured policy causes data exposure.

How it works:>

*YOu select the speccific resource in the IAM Access ananlyxer console
*Analyxer reviews it resource-based  policy 
*it shows you a list of principle that can access it and what action they can perform
*you decide whether to keep ,tightem or remove that access

3.Unused access
_________________
what it is:>
*A feature in IAM Access Analyxer that identifies IAM user ,roles,group,and policies that are unused or stale 

*unused means 
 *not used since  creation
 *not used in the last 90 days 
it checks activity lilke role assumption, API calls,and policy usage

where it is used:>
*to identify unused iam entities
*removing old user,key,or roless
*reduce clutter in IAM

why its improtant:>
*simplifies iam
*lowers the risks of accidental usage
*improves compilance
*reduces attack surface

4.Analyxer settings
________________
*Analyxer settting are the configuration options for IAM  Access analyxer
*they define how and where the analyxer runs
    scope:single account or entire AWS Organization 
    Region: which AWS region to monitor
*Essentially, its how you tell access analyxer which resources to scan and at what level

where its used:>
*region specific analyxer:
   ex: create an analyzer iin ap-south-1 to monitor all s3 buckets in that region  
*Organization -level analyzer
*checks all members accounts in you r aws organixation 
*useful fo centralixed auditing  of resourcses access across multiple accounts

why its important?

*you wont miss the resources in other regions or accounts
*security teams can monitor external access from one place
*shows that all accounts and region s are being monitored consistently
*only scan region /accounts you need avoiding unnecessary charges


5.CSV report(credentials report)
  A CSV report generated by IAM that lists all the IAM users in your account
  
shows their security-related details sush as :
*wheather their password is enabled
*whether MFA  is enabled
*Access key and thier last rotation date
*last console login
*last use of access key
*Account creation day

essenitally it's a snapshot of IAM user credentials and their  usage

where it is used
*check MFA enforce ment ,password  policies.
*find old or unused access keys 
*idenfify the user who have't logged in for months
*security compliance


Why Itâ€™s Important

Detect weak practices â†’ Users without MFA or with old keys are a risk.

Enforce credential hygiene â†’ Rotate keys, remove inactive users, enforce MFA.

Audit and compliance â†’ Provides evidence of secure IAM practices.

Reduce risk â†’ Minimizes chance of compromised credentials being exploited.


6.Organizational activity
 *organizational activity refers to monitoring  IAM  and resources activity across all accounts  in an aws organization

typically powered by:
*Aws cloud trail:> tracks API calls .user activity and  changes in accouts
*IAM accesss analyxer ->detect external or cross accoutn access

purpose :centralixed tracking of acions across multiple accountss

Where Itâ€™s Used

Track changes in member accounts â†’ Who created, modified, or deleted IAM roles/policies.

Detect governance violations â†’ Example: an account creating roles or policies outside your defined standards.

Audit cross-account access â†’ See which accounts or users are accessing resources outside their own account.

Security incident investigations â†’ Quickly identify which account caused a risky change.

ðŸ”¹ Why Itâ€™s Important

Centralized visibility â†’ One place to monitor all accounts in your org.

Enforce security standards â†’ Ensures consistent IAM and resource policies.

Simplifies audits and compliance â†’ Easy to report on multi-account activity.

Reduces risk of misconfigurations â†’ Spot risky or unauthorized actions early.


7.Service Control Policies (SCPs)
__________________________________

What it is:
_____________

IAM-like policies applied at the AWS Organization level.

Do not grant permissions; instead, they restrict what actions can be performed in member accounts.

Think of them as organization-wide guardrails that apply to all accounts in an AWS Organization.

Where itâ€™s used:
_________________

Deny EC2 instance termination for production accounts.

Restrict IAM role creation to only admin users.

Block use of specific services or regions, e.g., allow only us-east-1.

Why itâ€™s important:
_________________

Enforces guardrails across all accounts in the organization.

Prevents mistakes or malicious activity in child accounts.

Helps maintain consistent security and compliance across the organization.

8.Resource Control Policies
____________________________

What it is:
__________

Policies attached directly to specific resources, such as:

S3 bucket policies

KMS key policies

Secrets Manager resource policies

Define who can manage or access the resource.

Unlike SCPs, these are resource-level controls and can grant or restrict access.

Where itâ€™s used:
__________________

Restrict an S3 bucket to only the security team.

Control access to a KMS key so only certain roles can encrypt/decrypt.

Limit a Secrets Manager secret to only specific applications or users.

Why itâ€™s important:
________________

Enforces granular access control at the resource level.

Prevents unauthorized users from managing sensitive data or resources.

Complements account- and organization-level policies for fine-grained security.
